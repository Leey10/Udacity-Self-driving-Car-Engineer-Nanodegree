# **Behavioral Cloning** 


The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

#### 1. Files Included in Folder

My project includes the following files:
* model.py : a pipeline to train and valid the CNN for behavioral cloning
* drive.py : for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 : containing a trained convolution neural network 
* network.py: defines a neural network structure used by the project
* Data_processing.py : defines a class that includes all the methods necessary to process the training and validation data
